    "\n",
    "For a column vector we usually have a spatial representation in mind (as\n",

    "but you will get used to it in the course of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representations\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector in two dimensions is an object of which we have a clear notion:\n",
    "it is an arrow pointing from the origin to some point in the plane. We\n",
    "can represent this vector by two numbers, which we call the $x$ and $y$\n",
    "coordinates. However, if we change the basis, we obtain two *different*\n",
    "numbers: the *representation* has changed, but the object (the arrow) is\n",
    "still the same. We must always be explicit about the basis we use in\n",
    "order to translate the representation (a set of numbers) to the actual\n",
    "object. The object is fixed, but the representation is in some sense\n",
    "ephemeral, as it depends on the basis. To be specific, consider a vector\n",
    "$| u {\\rangle}$ in the plane. This has two components\n",
    "$u_x={\\langle}\\hat{e}_x | u{\\rangle}$ and\n",
    "$u_y={\\langle}\\hat{ e}_y | u{\\rangle}$. Here, the unit\n",
    "vectors are $\\hat{\\bf e}_x = | \\hat{e}_x{\\rangle}$ and\n",
    "$\\hat{\\bf e}_y = | \\hat{e}_y{\\rangle}$. If we change to a\n",
    "different basis $\\hat{\\bf g}_1 = | \\hat{g}_1{\\rangle}$,\n",
    "$\\hat{{{\\bf g}}}_2 = | \\hat{g}_2 {\\rangle}$, then the numbers\n",
    "representing the vector $| u {\\rangle}$ will change and\n",
    "become $u'_1={\\langle}\\hat{g}_1 | u{\\rangle}$ and\n",
    "$u'_2={\\langle}\\hat{g}_2 | u{\\rangle}$. We can specify the\n",
    "relation between these two bases by giving the $g$-basis in terms of the\n",
    "$e$-basis, that is, we need\n",
    "$g_{1x} = {\\langle}\\hat{e}_x | \\hat{g}_1{\\rangle}$ and\n",
    "similarly $g_{1y}$, $g_{2x}$ and $g_{2y}$. **Exercise:** express, using\n",
    "the numbers $g_{1x}$ etcetera, the numbers $u'_1$ and $u'_2$ in terms of\n",
    "$u_x$ and $u_y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is also a fixed object. But, if we have a function $f(x)$ on\n",
    "a one dimensional, perhaps infinite, interval, can we find a different\n",
    "representation of that function? The answer is yes. To give an example,\n",
    "we can calculate the Fourier transform $\\tilde{f}(k)$ of the function.\n",
    "This contains the same information as the original function, but the set\n",
    "of numbers $f(x)$ is different from the set of numbers $\\tilde{f}(k)$.\n",
    "In fact, the basis with respect to which we represent $f$ is infinite.\n",
    "In the $x$-representation, every point $x$ of the domain of $f$\n",
    "corresponds to a basis vector $| x {\\rangle}$. We have\n",
    "$$f(x) = {\\langle}x | f {\\rangle}.$$ The Fourier transform is\n",
    "a representation of the same function $f$ with respect to a different\n",
    "basis $| k {\\rangle}$:\n",
    "$$\\tilde{f}(k) = {\\langle}k | f {\\rangle}.$$ In order to find\n",
    "the relation between the two representations, we must find the numbers\n",
    "${\\langle}x | k {\\rangle}$. Further on, we will see that\n",
    "these are given by\n",
    "$${\\langle}x | k {\\rangle}= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{ikx}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- % In quantum mechanics, we often do Fourier transforms, but rather than\n",
    "% using the wave vector $k$, we use the momentum $p = \\hslash k $. This leads\n",
    "% to minor different relation between the bases:\n",
